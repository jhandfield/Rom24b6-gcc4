# Rom24b6-gcc4
A modified version of ROM 2.4b6 to work with GCC 4.x

# About
In preparation for resumption of work on a 
[related project](https://github.com/jhandfield/animated-barnacle/), I needed a
functioning version of the original ROM server to test against. Somewhat
unsurprisingly, the ROM source does not compile out of the box with a version of
gcc created nearly 20 years after the final release of ROM.

This project contains a slightly-modified version of the ROM 2.4b6 source that
will compile with gcc 4.x. I have made no intentional functional changes to the
source, but given my relatively weak C knowledge I can't guarantee I haven't
introduced or otherwise unknowingly unleashed some bugs upon the world.

# License
I have applied no additional licenses upon the source, as I feel I have made no
substantial improvements to the application. Refer to the original ROM, Diku,
and Merc licenses in the doc/ folder for details of the restrictions upon the
source.

# Feedback
I'm always interested in feedback, questions, encouragement, insults, spam, and
the occasional fruitcake, so feel free to create an issue through Github or
contact me via email @ [github@handfield.org](github@handfield.org).
